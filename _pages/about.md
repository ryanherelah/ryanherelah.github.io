Welcome to my world! Here is my personal website, where I share my photographs, ideas, and experiences. Hope you enjoy your stay! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me. I really like to meet new people and make new friends! ❤️

Self Introduction here 🌟:

I will graduate from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk) in October with a Master's degree in Information System Mangement. I will work as an IT consultant in [KPMG](https://kpmg.com/cn/en/home.html) from November.

I obtained my B.Mgmt. in Big data management and application from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2024. I’ve interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), [KPMG](https://www.kpmg.com/cn/en/home.html), [Ipsos Strategy3](https://www.ipsos.com/en/ipsosstrategy3) and [Ping An Technology](https://tech.pingan.com).

I have lots of hobbies. ✨ For sports, I like to play ping pong 🏓, hiking 🥾, squash 🎾, and jogging 🏃. For music, I like to play guitar 🎸 and sing 🎤. My love singers: 🌟 Khalil Fong, Jay Chou, Leehom Wang, G.E.M., Eason Chan, David Tao, Taylor Swift and so on. I did go to the Voice of SUSTech actually and I was TOP 20 singers actually! 🎉😝

For TV Series (OMG I really like watching them...😆), Friends would be my life-level series for sure ❤️📺. Also, I really love Japanese series 📺, such as Brush Up Life, Unnatural, MIU404, We Married As a Job, Legal High, Hanzawa Naoki, Tokyo Love Story and so on. I really love the feeling in Japanese dramas where the tenacious strength of life is revealed through their understated storytelling — it feels more authentic and grounded in humanity, and can always get closer to real life from certain perspectives❤️. That’s why I love Japanese dramas so much. Other likes: All Creatures Great and Small, Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Big Bang Theory, and so on.

For movies, just for saving space here I will not list them all. Like, Harry Potter Series ⚡, Interstellar 🌌, Green Book 🚗 and so on.

When you read until this part, I think you already know me (a lot) 😄. Please feel free to hang around in this website and have fun! 😊 Hope my posts will make you happy. 🌟 Last but not least, just let me know if you want to make friends with me. 💬🧑‍🤝‍🧑
