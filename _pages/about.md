I will graduate from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk) in October with a Master's degree in Information System Mangement. I will work as an IT consultant in [KPMG](https://kpmg.com/cn/en/home.html) from November.

I obtained my B.Mgmt. in Big data management and application from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2024. I’ve interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), [KPMG](https://www.kpmg.com/cn/en/home.html), [Ipsos Strategy3](https://www.ipsos.com/en/ipsosstrategy3) and [Ping An Technology](https://tech.pingan.com).
